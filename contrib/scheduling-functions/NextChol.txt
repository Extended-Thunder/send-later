Function name: NextChol

Author: Jonathan Kamens <jik@extended-thunder.org>

Help text
---------

Schedules the message to send a short time after the end of the current Sabbath
or Jewish holiday, or the next Sabbath or Jewish Holiday if it isn't currently
one (e.g., if you use this function on a regular Thursday the message will be
scheduled to be sent Saturday night). Useful if you use email at these times
but don't want to offend your Jewish friends who don't.

Note that this function calls out to a little HTTP API endpoint I wrote to
calculate the end time of the Sabbath or holiday.

You will probably want to edit the function after importing it to specify what
city you're in, so the times will be correct for you. See the API endpoint's
help page (https://jewish-holidays.kamens.us/next-chol?help) for a list of
supported cities.

// See https://jewish-holidays.kamens.us/next-chol?help for supported cities.
let city = 'Boston';
let url = 'https://jewish-holidays.kamens.us/next-chol?force&city=' + city;
let req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open('GET', url, false);
req.send();
if (req.readyState != 4)
  return;
if (req.status != 200) {
  msg = 'Error fetching from ' + url;
  throw(msg);
}
let matches = req.responseText.match(/^\s*(\d+)/);
if (matches.length < 1) {
  msg = url + ' did not return a number';
  throw(msg);
}
let unix_time = matches[1];
next = new Date();
next.setTime(unix_time * 1000);
next.setMinutes(next.getMinutes() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 15));
