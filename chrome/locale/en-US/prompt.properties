draftSaveWarning=WARNING: To prevent the message from being delivered by Send Later while you are editing it, its scheduled send time has been canceled. Please reschedule the message when you are done editing it.
AreYouSure=Are you sure?
OutboxConfirmMessage=Clicking “Put in Outbox” puts the message in your Outbox immediately. It DOES NOT schedule the message to be sent at a specific time. For that, click the “Send around” button in the green box after entering a valid send time. Are you sure you want to put the message in your Outbox now?
SendNowConfirmMessage=Clicking “Send Now” sends the message immediately. It DOES NOT schedule the message to be sent at a specific time. For that, click the “Send around” button in the green box after entering a valid send time. Are you sure you want to send the message now?

ScheduledMessagesWarningTitle=Scheduled messages warning
ScheduledMessagesWarningQuitRequested=There are messages scheduled to be sent. Send Later can only send messages when %S is running. Are you sure you want to exit?
ScheduledMessagesWarningQuit=Send Later can only send messages when %S is running. Please remember to restart it before your messages are scheduled to be sent!
EnigmailIncompatTitle=Send Later / Enigmail compatibility issue

TimeMismatchConfirmTitle=Send time / restriction mismatch
TimeMismatchConfirmBody=The send time %1$S does not fall within the specified time restrictions. Click Cancel to edit your send time or restrictions, or OK to adjust it automatically to %2$S.
endTimeWarningTitle=Invalid message time restriction
endTimeWarningBody=When specifying a message time restriction, the end time cannot be earlier than the start time. Please adjust your time restriction or disable it.
missingDaysWarningTitle=Invalid day restriction
missingDaysWarningBody=You have enabled a message day restriction without specifying any days. Please disable the day restriction or specify at least one delivery day.
InvalidArgsTitle=Invalid function arguments
InvalidArgsBody=The function arguments are not valid. Specify a JavaScript list, without the enclosing square braces.
BlockedLateMessage=The message with subject “%1$S” in Drafts folder %2$S was scheduled to be delivered more than %3$S minutes ago, so delivery has been blocked. You should edit the draft and either send it by hand or reschedule it. You can also disable the “Don't deliver messages more than # minutes late” preference to stop blocking delivery of late messages.
EditorReadMeCode=// Welcome to the Send Later function editor!\n//\n// The editor allows you to create JavaScript functions implementing complex\n// message scheduling logic which can be associated with shortcut buttons or\n// selected in the Send Later dialog.\n//\n// As you can see above, when a scheduling function is called, it will be given\n// three arguments:\n// * "specname" is needed if you want this function to recur (see below)\n// * "prev" is the previous scheduled send time, if this is a recurring\n//   invocation\n// * "args" is the extra arguments returned by the previous invocation if this\n//   is a recurring invocation\n//\n// Your code needs to set the variables "next", "nextspec", and\n// "nextargs" as follows:\n//\n// * "next" is either the number of minutes in the future or a Date object\n//   indicating when the message should be sent.\n// * "nextspec" is a recurrence specification if this is intended to be a\n//   recurring message (see\n//   http://blog.kamens.us/send-later/#dynamic-recurrence). If you don't set\n//   this, then the message will only be sent once. Note: if you want your\n//   function to be called again for recurrence, do:\n//     nextspec = "function " + specname\n// * "nextargs" is an array of arguments you want to be passed into the next\n//   invocation of the function as "args".\n//\n// While you are working on your function, you can test it by filling in values\n// for "prev" and "args" in the Text boxes below and then clicking "Run" to\n// execute the function and see the results.\n//\n// There are two pre-configured sample functions, "BusinessHours" and\n// "DaysInARow", which you can look at and play with to learn more.\n//\n// This "ReadMeFirst" function just causes the message to be sent around now,\n// via the following line.\nnext = new Date();
EditorReadMeHelp=Any text you put here will be displayed as a tooltip when you hover over the name of the function in the menu. You can use this to document what the function does and what arguments it accepts.

BusinessHoursHelp=Send the message now if it is during business hours, or at the beginning of the next work day. You can change the definition of work days (default: Mon - Fri) by passing in an array of work-day numbers as the first argument, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday. You can change the work start or end time (default: 8:30 - 17:30) by passing in an array of [H, M] as the second or third argument. Specify "null" for earlier arguments you don't change. For example, "null, [9, 0], [17, 0]" changes the work hours without changing the work days.
DaysInARowCode=// Send the first message now, subsequent messages once per day.\nif (! prev)\n    next = new Date();\nelse {\n    var now = new Date();\n    next = new Date(prev); // Copy date argument so we don't modify it.\n    do {\n        next.setDate(next.getDate() + 1);\n    } while (next < now);\n    // ^^^ Don't try to send in the past, in case Thunderbird was asleep at\n    // the scheduled send time.\n}\nif (! args) // Send messages three times by default.\n    args = [3];\nnextargs = [args[0] - 1];\n// Recur if we haven't done enough sends yet.\nif (nextargs[0] > 0)\n    nextspec = "function " + specname;
DaysInARowHelp=Send the message now, and subsequently once per day at the same time, until it has been sent three times. Specify a number as an argument to change the total number of sends.
